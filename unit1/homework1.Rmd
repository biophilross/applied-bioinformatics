#### What flags will make the ls command write out the file sizes in a more user-friendly format?

Using the **ls -lh** command can do this for you

#### What flag will make the rm command ask your permission before removing a file?

Using the **rm -i** command can do this for you

#### What flag will make the cp command ask for permission before clobbering?

Using **cp -i** will do the same as **rm -i** in that it will interactively ask you whether you're sure you want to overwrite an existing file. Using **cp -n** will prevent clobbering altogether. 

#### To make the ref, bin, and src directories I used...

mkdir -p $HOME/applied-bioinformatics/ref $HOME/applied-bioinformatics/bin $HOME/applied-bioinformatics/src
