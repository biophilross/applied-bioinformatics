#### How many protein sequences are there fort he Ebola virus sequencing paper?

Running the following commands can tell us that:
``` {r question1, engine='bash', eval = FALSE}
$ esearch -db protein -query PRJNA257197 | efetch -format fasta > ebola_aa.fasta
$ cat ebola_aa.fasta | grep ">" | wc -l
```

And from this we see that we have **2240** sequences.

#### Unpack at least three SRR runs and see what's inside.
